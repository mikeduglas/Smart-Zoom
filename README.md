# Smart-Zoom

Smart Zoom template enables web browser-like zoom feature in your applications, that is, the combination "Ctrl + Mouse wheel" zooms in and out any LIST or TEXT.  
Optionally it may display percent value of zoom factor, and reset to defaults.  

**For LIST control Smart Zoom cares about column widths and row heights, and correctly handles styles applied to the list.**

In version 1.01:
- Ctrl-0 resets active control's zoom
- The template allows to save/restore zoom level

## Price
- 30 USD

## Requirements  
- C6.3 and newer; old Clarion versions have not tested, but probably will work as well.
- Both ABC and Clarion template chains.
- No black boxes: only Clarion source files and templates.

## How to enable Smart Zoom in your application
Add Smart Zoom global extension, and that's all! All your windows now support zooming for lists and texts.

## Demo application SCHOOL
- Hit the 'Clone or Download' button and select 'Download Zip'
- Unzip zip file into a temporary folder somewhere
- Run School.exe, choose any item from "Tree" or "Browse" menu, and play with zooming via Ctrl-Mouse wheel.  
"Students" browse also displays zoom factor indicator and a button to reset.  
In this app there is only one TEXT control - Browse|Courses|Change, you can see how Smart Zoom works with texts there.
