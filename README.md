# Smart-Zoom

Smart Zoom template enables web browser-like zoom feature in your applications, that is, the combination "Ctrl + Mouse wheel" zooms in and out any LIST or TEXT.  
Optionally it may display percent value of zoom factor, and reset to defaults.  

**For LIST control Smart Zoom cares about column widths and row heights, and correctly handles styles applied to the list.**

- Ctrl-0 resets active control's zoom
- The template allows to save/restore zoom level
